# NoBullFit

NoBullFit is a privacy-first health and fitness tracking platform designed to help you monitor your nutrition, discover recipes, track your progress, and manage your wellness journey — all while keeping your data private and secure.

## About

NoBullFit is source-available software, meaning the source code is publicly accessible for transparency and learning purposes. The platform is currently under active development but is already available for free use at [nobull.fit](https://nobull.fit).

We prioritize data privacy above all else. Your information belongs to you, and we don't sell your data to third parties. Essential features will always remain free, ensuring that privacy and basic functionality are not premium features.

## Features

### Food Database
Browse a comprehensive database of foods with detailed nutritional information powered by the Edamam API. Search for foods, view complete macronutrient and micronutrient breakdowns, and access measurement options for accurate tracking.

### Food Tracking
Log your daily meals and snacks with detailed nutritional tracking. Organize entries by meal categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Other), track calories and macronutrients, and maintain a complete food diary. Support for both individual food items and recipe-based entries.

### Recipe Database
Discover and create recipes with complete nutritional breakdowns. Save your own recipes, browse public recipes from other users, and log recipe servings directly to your food tracking. Each recipe includes detailed ingredient lists, step-by-step instructions, and per-serving nutritional information.

### Progress Tracking
Monitor your fitness activities and exercises. Log various activity types including running, weightlifting, HIIT, and more. Track calories burned, activity-specific metrics (distance, duration, pace, reps, sets, etc.), and view your activity history over time.

### Weight Tracking
Record and monitor your weight over time with support for both kilograms and pounds. Automatic unit conversion ensures consistent tracking regardless of your preferred unit. View weight trends in the dashboard overview.

### Dashboard Overview
Comprehensive data visualization with interactive charts and statistics. View daily calorie consumption vs. calories burned, macronutrient breakdowns, activity type distributions, food category analysis, and weight trends. Filter data by time period (7 days, 30 days, or all time).

### Grocery Lists

### Favorites
Save your frequently used foods and recipes for quick access. Quickly add favorited items to your food tracking or grocery lists.
