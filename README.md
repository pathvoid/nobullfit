A free food tracking and progress monitoring application built with privacy as the foundation. NoBullFit helps you track your nutrition, monitor your fitness progress, and maintain your health goals while keeping your personal data secure and private.

## Mission

NoBullFit provides a free platform for tracking food intake, nutritional data, and personal fitness progress while prioritizing your data privacy above all else. We believe that tracking your nutrition and fitness progress shouldn't come at the cost of your privacy.

## Privacy Commitment

Your data belongs to you. We don't sell your information to third parties, and we minimize data collection to only what's necessary for the service to function. Your privacy is not a premium feature - it's our foundation.
